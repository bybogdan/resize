## Resize

- upload an image to the browser and see a preview of that image
- on image click label will added to the place where the click occurred
- on click on an existing label, it will be removed
- during resize the browser window, the image will be scaled
- changing image scaling, the labels save their coordinates relative to the
  image
- if you checked checkbox (under input), during resizing if the labels will
  start to go beyond the preview, their coordinates will be updated to prevent
  this, as long as the preview is large enough.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
